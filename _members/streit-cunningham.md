W. Streit Cunningham is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at University of Virginia. Dr. Cunningham earned his Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering at Stony Brook University in 2016, and a BS degree in Physics from Johns Hopkins University. Prior to joining UVA, Dr. Cunningham was a NSF MPS-Ascend Postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The Accelerated Materials Discovery lab focuses on building and applying high-throughput methodologies for the creation and optimization of novel materials. To that end, Dr. Cunningham has had a long-standing interest in the development of automated and in-situ techniques across a broad spectrum of materials characterization approaches. The Accelerated Materials Discovery lab primarily leverages their expertise in materials discovery to explore the optimization of structural materials for extreme environments, such as those found inside next-generation nuclear reactors.
