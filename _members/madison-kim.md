Madison Kim is an undergraduate Biology major at the University of Virginia on a pre-dental track.

Her interests focus on nanoindentation and data collection to study the mechanical properties of materials. Previously, she gained experience in the synthesis and characterization of transition-metal complexes, which sparked her interest in how material behavior under stress can inform biomedical applications. Madison is particularly interested in applying materials science approaches to dentistry, with the goal of improving the durability and biocompatibility of endodontic materials. Outside the lab, she enjoys going to the gym, traveling with her family, and scouting out new caf√©s to study at with her friends.
