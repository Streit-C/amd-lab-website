The Accelerated Materials Discovery Lab is focused on applying automated and high-throughput methodologies to discover and develop novel materials for extreme environments (high mechanical stresses, temperatures, and radiation fluxes). We utilize procedures derived from ‘self-driving labs’ to guide a microstructural optimization loop through combinatorial synthesis approaches (typically thin film sputtering), microstructural modification, and high-throughput characterization. We are particularly interested in developing novel characterization approaches, from in-situ to high-throughput, and apply our expertise to a wide-range of characterization techniques, including: X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy, electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), small-scale mechanical testing, and thermal analysis (ultrafast nanocalorimetry). On the materials side, we apply modern metallurgy approaches to develop novel engineered materials, leveraging our knowledge of microstructures and chemistry to optimize alloy systems.
