Calcium imaging recording uses the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP, to record the neural activity of genetically defined subpopulations of neurons through a miniscope in freely moving rodents. We use this technique to do cell-type specific recordings in nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) while animals are performing different behaviors task, for example as defensive burying or self-administration. This technique allows us to understand cell-type and temporally specific signaling that encodes information about the underlying neurobiology of stress and addiction.
