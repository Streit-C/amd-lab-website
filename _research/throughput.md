The associated costs for developing radiation-tolerant materials, starting from conceptualization and synthesis all the way to testing under neutron environments, are prohibitively expensive and thereby significantly slow down the concept-to-application pipeline. To combat this issue, we utilize high-throughput and autonomous methodologies to explore complex material spaces followed by targeted mechanistic studies. Through the generation of combinatorial samples, we can rapidly probe vast compositional spaces, while robotics enable autonomous control of sample generation and characterization.
